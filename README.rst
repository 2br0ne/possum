POSSUM is a software for point of sales (POS) specially designed for 
restaurant / bar / brasserie.

It is advisable to use at least a ticket printer and a touch screen.

POSSUM can be used to provide billing and presents different statistical 
(Sales, VAT amount, total payments by payment type, settings, average 
ticket per table, ...). These statistics are calculated per day and per 
month and help the manager to know the trade trend sales.

as a jukebox to play music in the restaurant.
